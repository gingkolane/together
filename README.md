# Together - Contact Tracing through Self-Reporting

App Summary: 
Self-reporting, integrated testing, data analysis on home treatment patients. 

“Together” is a mobile app that allows the general public toself-report COVID-19 cases. It uses the honor system and the goodwill of the general public to acquire information. It allows this population to manage their testing and treatment themselves by requesting a COVID-19 diagnostic or antibody test, getting the test and receiving results in an integrated and contact-free way, and notifying others whom they may have come in contact with.

The app integrates and optimizes the discovery, care, testing and hospitalization process. Self-reporting starts much earlier than healthcare-based tools so the progression of the disease can be monitored.

"Together" enables treatment life-cycle management. Starting from the test request, it provides a platform for authorizing and scheduling testing and managing the testing site. QR codes for the test and patient are in the app itself so no contact is needed at the test site, and the process is efficient.

"Together" provides a vast new source of COVID-19 contact tracing. Currently available public data is by state or city only and congregated; fine-grained data is not available and testing data is very limited. Together gives us a window into the 80% of the infected population that is not yet in the hospital, or that will never go to the hospital. Data analysis from the app and official testing results can be combined to support more efficient contact-tracing.

App Functions:
- A user can create case reports for themselves or for others
- A user can request a diagnostics test or antibody test, schedule a test, visit the test site and get tested (providing a QR code from the app,) and receive test results, all within the app
- Tests can be done with minimum contact. The user identifies themselves with a QR code on the app, which is linked to the testing kit QR code at the testing site. Testing data will be sent to the user on the app when it becomes available.
- If the user tests positive, they can send notifications to others who might be infected.

Future goals:
- Acquire verified government testing results
- Populate a map showing density of COVID-19 infection at the individual level
- Analysis of self-reporting and verified testing data can be analyzed, with the help of AI, to predict and forestall infection hotspots.
